# Set-loftlights

## What does it do?
Manages three Hive TWGU10Bulb03UK lights through Home Assistant's REST API.

## Why?
Because i wanted to control the loft lights from my console window. Nothing more. 

## Did you write it?
I architected it, but Claude Code wrote it. It's part of me learning how to use Claude but write useful stuff and practice command line stuff.

## Yeah but... 
Don't overthink it. Its not that deep. Its a script that turns on\off or dim's three lights in a room.
